# RubySapphireRecomp — Pokémon Ruby + Sapphire, Recompiled

Static recompilation of **Pokémon Ruby** and **Pokémon Sapphire** (Game Boy
Advance) to native PC, built on the
[`gbarecomp`](https://github.com/mstan/gbarecomp) framework.

One repo hosts **both** games as separate native targets sharing one source tree
and one engine (the [Sonic3AndKnucklesRecomp](https://github.com/mstan/Sonic3AndKnucklesRecomp)
multi-variant pattern — an `add_gba_variant()` CMake function emits one executable
per game). Their Gen3 siblings live in
[`FireRedLeafGreenRecomp`](https://github.com/mstan/FireRedLeafGreenRecomp) (FireRed + LeafGreen) and
[`EmeraldRecomp`](https://github.com/mstan/EmeraldRecomp).

> ### Status — playable bring-up (v0.0.1), and self-improving
>
> This is a **static-recompilation base + runner**, not a finished port. Both
> games **boot through the BIOS intro to the title screen and into gameplay**.
> It is **early** — not every code path is statically recompiled yet, and content
> has not been exhaustively tested. (Ruby & Sapphire are the oldest Gen3 engine;
> expect a few more early-boot and flash/RTC quirks than FireRed/Emerald.)
>
> **It gets better the more you play.** Any code path the static recompiler hasn't
> covered runs through a built-in **interpreter the first time it's hit**, then is
> **JIT-compiled to native** (in-process, no toolchain needed) and **remembered on
> disk** — so the next launch runs it natively from the start. Interpreted once,
> native ever after; coverage grows toward fully-native as the game is played. See
> [How it self-improves](#how-it-self-improves).

## What "static recompilation" means here

The ROM's **ARM7TDMI machine code is statically translated to native C** — every
function the game runs becomes a real generated C function. Unlike most recomp
projects, **the GBA BIOS is recompiled and executed too** (not HLE'd or stubbed),
so the boot sequence and interrupt/SWI handlers run as real recompiled code. The
rest of the console — the PPU (graphics), APU + M4A sound engine, DMA, timers, the
cartridge flash save chip + RTC, and hardware I/O — is modeled by the `gbarecomp`
runtime.

Only **symbol metadata** (function names, addresses, sizes) from the
[`pret/pokeruby`](https://github.com/pret/pokeruby) decompilation enters this repo
— never its C source, build output, or toolchain. **The ROM is never
redistributed**; you supply your own legally-dumped copy.

## Variants

| Target           | Game              | ROM (USA)   | SHA-1                                      | Debug port |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|------------|
| `RubyRecomp`     | Pokémon Ruby      | rev1        | `610b96a9c9a7d03d2bafb655e7560ccff1a6d894` | 19872      |
| `SapphireRecomp` | Pokémon Sapphire  | rev1        | `4722efb8cd45772ca32555b98fd3b9719f8e60a9` | 19882      |

The runtime **refuses to launch on an unrecognized ROM** — the SHA-1 must match.

## Quick start

1. Download the latest `RubyRecomp-` / `SapphireRecomp-windows-x64` zip from
   [Releases](../../releases) and extract it (or build from source — see below).
2. Run the executable for the game you built.
3. Supply your own **legally-obtained** Ruby / Sapphire (USA) ROM when prompted.
   The path is cached next to the exe for future launches.
4. Play. Early on you may briefly see the interpreter warm up new code paths; once
   warmed (and cached), they run native.

## Controls

| GBA button | Keyboard      |
|------------|---------------|
| D-Pad      | Arrow keys    |
| A          | Z             |
| B          | X             |
| Start      | Enter         |
| Select     | Backspace     |

Save states: **Shift+F1–F9** save to a slot, **F1–F9** load it.

## How it self-improves

`gbarecomp`'s coverage is honest: a path that wasn't statically recompiled is
**bridged through the interpreter** the first time, *loudly*, then healed:

- **First hit:** the interpreter runs the missed function (correct, just not
  native) and the runtime records it.
- **Heal:** the function is **JIT-compiled to native in-process** via a
  toolchain-less backend (sljit) — no compiler required on your machine.
- **Persist:** the healed path is written to a per-ROM cache
  (`recomp_cache/<rom-sha1>/`), so **the next launch re-JITs it up front** and it
  runs native from the start.

The result is a game that converges toward fully-native execution the more it's
played, and **stays** improved across launches. A handful of instruction patterns
the JIT can't lower yet stay on the interpreter (precision over recall); those are
emitter gaps that close over time. Self-improvement is on by default; set
`GBARECOMP_SELFHEAL_RECOMPILE=0` for a pure-interpreter run.

## Building from source

**Prerequisites (Windows):** [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) with the mingw64
toolchain (`gcc`/`g++`), CMake 3.16+, Ninja, and SDL2 (mingw64 package). Builds
are invoked from PowerShell with the mingw64 toolchain on `PATH`.

**1. Clone this repo next to `gbarecomp`** (the game repo builds against the
sibling engine checkout on `main`):

```
git clone https://github.com/mstan/gbarecomp.git
git clone https://github.com/mstan/RubySapphireRecomp.git
cd RubySapphireRecomp
```

**2. Supply your ROM(s)** at `variants/ruby/roms/ruby_usa.gba` and/or
`variants/sapphire/roms/sapphire_usa.gba` (SHA-1s above). ROMs are gitignored and
never committed.

**3. Recompile + build.** The committed `variants/*/symbols/*.toml` are the
importer output, so you can regenerate the C and build directly:

```
# from PowerShell, mingw64 on PATH
gba_recompile --rom variants/ruby/roms/ruby_usa.gba \
              --config variants/ruby/symbols/ruby_usa.toml \
              --out variants/ruby/generated
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build --target RubyRecomp
```

(`gba_recompile` is built from the `gbarecomp` checkout; see that repo's README.)
The recompiled translation unit is large — expect a multi-minute compile.

## Legal

This project contains **no copyrighted ROM data, no Nintendo BIOS, and no decomp
source** — only original recompiler/runtime code and symbol metadata. **You must
supply your own legally-dumped ROM** (and BIOS, where the runtime requires one).
Pokémon, Ruby, and Sapphire are trademarks of Nintendo / Game Freak / The Pokémon
Company; this project is an unaffiliated, non-commercial preservation and research
effort.
